# SecondTry..... Enough Said.......
I felt things started off well, I a good "game" plan....Which shortly changed.. Its now almost 1 A.M., and I am  just trying to scape by to have an MVP.. I will be revisiting and changing quite a few things on this project! I am pretty dissapointed in myself but I will say that, a lot of what I thought I didnt know or started to make sense! Still a long way to go but very excited about the Journey. I was able to use the library TweenMax which was amazing! I fee I am getting more comfortable with loops and functions. But Screw Collision Detection.....
