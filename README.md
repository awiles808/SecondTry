# SecondTry..... Enough Said.......
Started out off with a good "game" plan....Which shortly changed.. Its now almost 1 AM,and I am trying to scape by to have an MVP.. I will be revisiting and changing somethings on this project! Even though I am pretty dissapointed in myself I will say  a lot of what I thought I didnt know started to make sinse! Still a long way to go but very excited about the Journey. I was able to use the library TweenMax which was amazing! Getting a better grasp on loops and functions. And Screw Hit Detection.....
